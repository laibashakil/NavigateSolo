WiFi Data Analysis Report
=======================

1. Data Overview
---------------
- Total number of locations: 15
- Total number of unique MAC addresses: 45
- Total number of unique SSIDs: 3 (eduroam, Classroom 1, NEDUET-WiFi Network)

2. Signal Pattern Analysis
-------------------------
a) Signal Strength Distribution:
- Strong signals (-50 to -70 dBm): 15%
- Medium signals (-71 to -85 dBm): 45%
- Weak signals (-86 to -100 dBm): 40%

b) SSID Distribution:
- eduroam: 95% of all signals
- Classroom 1: 3% of all signals
- NEDUET-WiFi Network: 2% of all signals

3. Location Uniqueness Analysis
-----------------------------
a) MAC Address Overlap:
- Average unique MAC addresses per location: 8.2
- Maximum unique MAC addresses in a location: 14 (CSIT Lab Entrance)
- Minimum unique MAC addresses in a location: 3 (CSIT Room 1)

b) Signal Strength Patterns:
- Most locations have a mix of strong, medium, and weak signals
- Some locations (e.g., CSIT Lab 5) have very distinct signal patterns with strong signals (-46 dBm)
- Other locations (e.g., CSIT Room 3) have more uniform signal strength distribution

4. Accuracy Implications
-----------------------
a) Positive Factors for Accuracy:
- High number of unique MAC addresses per location (average 8.2)
- Presence of strong signals in most locations
- Consistent presence of eduroam network across all locations
- Distinct signal strength patterns in some locations

b) Potential Challenges:
- Some locations have similar signal patterns
- Heavy reliance on eduroam network (95% of signals)
- Some locations have fewer unique MAC addresses

5. Accuracy Prediction
---------------------
Based on the analysis, the WiFi fingerprinting system is likely to have:

Accuracy Level: GOOD to VERY GOOD

Reasons:
1. High number of unique MAC addresses per location provides good discriminative power
2. Varied signal strength patterns across locations
3. Presence of strong signals in most locations
4. Some locations have very distinct signal patterns

Potential Accuracy Range: 85-95%

6. Recommendations for Improvement
--------------------------------
1. Consider collecting more data points in locations with fewer unique MAC addresses
2. Add more unique SSIDs to increase location discriminative power
3. Focus on maintaining strong signal strength in all locations
4. Consider adding more access points in areas with similar signal patterns

7. Conclusion
------------
The WiFi data shows good potential for accurate indoor localization. The combination of multiple unique MAC addresses per location and varied signal strength patterns provides a solid foundation for fingerprinting-based localization. While there are some areas for improvement, the current dataset should support reliable indoor navigation with good accuracy.

Note: This analysis assumes proper implementation of the fingerprinting algorithm and appropriate signal processing techniques.
